p After going through the NYC filter, Western wear becomes mysterious, dark and sensual. Whether it be with all-black ensembles or revealing details such as mesh or cutouts, girls take Western to a fierce place. Accessories drive the look home, with hats, oversized concho belts, Western booties with silver, and turquoise jewellery confirming the inspiration.
